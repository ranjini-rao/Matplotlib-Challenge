## Matplotlib-Challenge

# Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.


- Prepare the Data
- Generate Summary Statistics
- Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts
- Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot
- Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot
- Calculate Correlation and Regression
# Summary
- First Observation: By looking at the bar graph, number of mice that was tested for Capomulin and Ramicane 
#had almost same amount of mouse. Gender Distribution shows in pie chart that male mice was relatively 
#more than the female mice

- Second Observation: The results for Tumor Volume For Each Treatment Group shows that treatment with Capomulin or Ramicane
#has the smaller tumor volume than the others treatment regimens.

- Third Observation: By observing the output of the scatter plot, it can be said that the tumor size and the weight
#of the mouse was correlated. The heavier the weight of the mouse the bigger the size of tumor.
